    # We want cross-language seeds, so we cannot use 64-bit integers since those are not supported
    # on all platforms. Unsigned integers are also not supported on many platforms. Most platforms will
    # either support 32-bit signed integers, or float64 values. Float64 values can represent all 32-bit integers
    # exactly, so limiting our seeds to 32-bit integers allows us to support the widest number of platforms.
    #
    # If you want cross-platform results, use seeds in the range: -2147483648 <= seed and seed <= 21474836487
    #
    # But, if the platform supports 64-bit integers or for languages like python where integers have no limits,
    # then we'd rather not throw an exception if something else is provided. We can convert non-portable seeds
    # into something that fits our API by taking modulos to force them into our cross-platform range
    #
    # We use a simple conversion because we use the same method in multiple languages,
    # and we need to keep the results identical between them, so simplicity is key.
    #
    # The result of the modulo operator is not standardized accross languages for negative numbers.
    # We can use rounding on divisions to get standardized modulos, and this will work with float64 inputs too.
