# APLR
Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression.

# About
Build predictive and interpretable parametric regression or classification machine learning models in Python based on the Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression (APLR) methodology developed by Mathias von Ottenbreit. APLR is often able to compete with tree-based methods on predictiveness, but unlike tree-based methods APLR is interpretable. Furthermore, APLR produces smoother predictions than tree-based methods. Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/ottenbreit-data-science/aplr/tree/main/documentation) for more information. Links to published article: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-024-01475-4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-024-01475-4) and [https://rdcu.be/dz7bF](https://rdcu.be/dz7bF). More functionality has been added to APLR since the article was published.
